## Overview

The **Quantum-Entangled Multi-State Storage System (QEMS) Prototype** simulates how quantum principles can revolutionize energy storage. In this model, we simulate three key components:

- **Entanglement & Quantum Memory Simulation:** We create a GHZ state (an entangled state) using Qiskit. A barrier in the circuit simulates the “storage” phase where the entangled state is maintained.
- **Superposition-Based Charge/Discharge Simulation:** Using Cirq, we demonstrate a single qubit in superposition, representing a battery that is simultaneously charged and discharged.
- **Hybrid Quantum-Classical Optimization:** With PennyLane, we run a variational algorithm to optimize system parameters in real time, mimicking adaptive energy distribution.

## Features

- **Quantum Entanglement Simulation:** Prepare a robust 3-qubit GHZ state and simulate a quantum memory phase.
- **Quantum Memory Simulation:** Use barriers to represent the storage phase where the quantum state is preserved.
- **Superposition Demonstration:** Show how a qubit in superposition can represent dual energy states.
- **Hybrid Optimization:** Utilize a variational quantum algorithm to optimize system parameters dynamically.
- **Modular Design:** The project is organized into separate modules for clarity and extensibility.
- **Visualization:** Circuit diagrams and measurement histograms are generated to provide clear visual feedback.

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8 or later:** Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Git (Optional):** For version control, download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads/).

### 2. Downloading the Project

Since the repository URL provided earlier was a placeholder, you need to create the project directory manually:
- Create a folder called `qems_project` on your Desktop.
- Inside this folder, create the directory structure as shown above and add the provided files.

Alternatively, if you want to use Git:
- Create your own GitHub repository named `qems_project`.
- Clone it using your repository URL (e.g., `https://github.com/YourUsername/qems_project.git`).

### 3. Setting Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

Open a command prompt in the `qems_project` directory and run:
```bash
python -m venv env


## Activate the environment:

Windows:

env\Scripts\activate

macOS/Linux:

source env/bin/activate


##4. Installing Dependencies
Within the activated environment, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
This installs:

Qiskit for quantum circuit simulation.
Cirq for superposition demonstrations.
PennyLane for hybrid quantum-classical optimization.
Matplotlib for plotting graphs.

## How to Run the Project
From the command prompt (with your virtual environment activated and in the qems_project directory), run:

python main.py

This will sequentially execute:

Entanglement & Quantum Memory Simulation:
Creates a GHZ state with Qiskit, simulates a storage phase, and displays the circuit diagram and measurement histogram.
Superposition-Based Charge/Discharge Simulation:
Demonstrates a qubit in superposition with Cirq and prints the measurement outcomes.
Hybrid Quantum-Classical Optimization:
Runs a variational quantum algorithm using PennyLane to optimize parameters and prints the optimization progress.



Module Descriptions
Entanglement & Quantum Memory Simulation
File: entanglement/ghz_state.py
Description:
Uses Qiskit to create a 3-qubit GHZ state ((|000⟩ + |111⟩)/√2) with a barrier simulating a quantum memory storage phase. Measurements verify the state is maintained.
Superposition-Based Charge/Discharge Simulation
File: superposition/superposition_demo.py
Description:
Uses Cirq to prepare a single qubit in a superposition state (via the Hadamard gate) and measures it, representing a battery that is in a dual state until discharged.
Hybrid Quantum-Classical Optimization
File: optimization/variational_optimization.py
Description:
Implements a simple variational quantum algorithm using PennyLane. A variational circuit is optimized using gradient descent, simulating how system parameters (like energy levels) can be tuned dynamically.
Future Enhancements
Scalability: Extend the simulation to more qubits or qudits.
Noise Modeling: Incorporate noise and decoherence models.
Data Integration: Connect the variational optimization to external data (e.g., weather, energy demand).
Enhanced Visualization: Improve graphical outputs for better analysis.
Hardware Testing: Explore running the circuits on cloud-based quantum hardware (IBM Quantum, Rigetti, etc.).
